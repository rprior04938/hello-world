# hello-world
First Exercise.
I'm almost 75, been programming for over 50 years but now very behind in modern techniques.  I'm trying to learn how to edit Joe's Koko and Kanzi so that they work for me.  It's hard work, since I've never really used Python before, much less Node and all the of the other stuff that Joe seems to use regularly.
